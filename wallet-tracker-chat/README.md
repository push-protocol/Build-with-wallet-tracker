# Wallet Tracker Chat

Wallet Tracker Chat provides you with a user-friendly interface to utilize the same features as the Wallet Tracker Channel, with a few additional enhancements. Wallet Tracker Chat uses Push Chat as the chatting interface. You can read more about Push Chat [here](https://push.org/docs/chat/).

## Setting Up the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/push-protocol/Build-with-wallet-tracker.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the `wallet-tracker-chat` folder:**
    ```
    cd wallet-tracker-chat/
    ```

3. **Install packages and set up environment variables:**
    We have simplified this process for you. Use the `setup.js` script to complete the setup.
    ```
    node setup.js
    ```
    Make sure to enter the correct details. If anything goes sideways, check the newly created `.env` file.

4. **Start the project:**
    ```
    npm start
    ```

You should now have the Wallet Tracker Chat up and running, ready to serve your queries.
